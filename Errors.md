The code is tested for xmin = -3.747, xmax = 3.747, ymin = -3.747, ymax = 3.747, rho = 0.5, p =  0.25, and varies theta value from π/3 to π/11 and nbox value from 5 to 40 (to 50 for theta = π/3, π/4). It has problems with the following parameters: <br />
nbox = 24, theta = π/3 (2 small amount of leftovers in demand[]); <br />
nbox = 28, theta = π/3 (2 small amount of leftovers in demand[]); <br />
nbox = 30, theta = π/3 (2 small amount of leftovers in supply[]); <br />
nbox = 17, theta = π/6 (caught in an infinite loop at some point); <br />
nbox = 22, theta = π/6 (2 small amount of leftovers in supply[]); <br />
nbox = 39, theta = π/6 (print repeated values at some point); <br />
nbox = 33, theta = π/7 (caught in an infinite loop at some point); <br />
nbox = 36, theta = π/7 (caught in an infinite loop at some point); <br />
nbox = 38, theta = π/7 (caught in an infinite loop at some point); <br />
nbox = 40, theta = π/7 (print repeated values at some point); <br />
nbox = 36, theta = π/8 (caught in an infinite loop at some point); <br />
nbox = 39, theta = π/8 (print repeated values at some point); <br />
nbox = 34, theta = π/9 (print repeated values at some point); <br />
nbox = 38, theta = π/9 (2 small amount of leftovers in supply[]); <br />
nbox = 18, theta = π/10 (2 small amount of leftovers in supply[]); <br />
nbox = 20, theta = π/10 (2 small amount of leftovers in supply[]); <br />
nbox = 40, theta = π/11 (caught in an infinite loop at some point); <br />
nbox = 18, theta = π/11 (2 small amount of leftovers in supply[]); <br />
nbox = 20, theta = π/11 (2 small amount of leftovers in supply[]); <br />
